dotfiles
========

Various files from my home directory.

I find that setting up a new computer is a pain,
so my goal is to be able to clone this repo,
run ./install.sh, and be mostly done.  We shall
see how close I can get :-)

Note that the various computers I use have
different GUI's (if any at all), so I will
have dotfiles for various environments.
